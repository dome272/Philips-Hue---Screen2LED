# Philips-Hue --- Screen2LED
A simple python script for making your Philips LED color change based on the colors of your screen - creating a cozy picture in your room.

## Explanation:
Commonly known from TV's is the Ambient Light mode, where the LED behind the TV changes based on the colors of the screen itself. I wanted to make this a program myself just for my computer screen.
